# Numerically-Modelling-Rutherford-Scattering
The aim of the project is to numerically model Rutherford scattering and investigate how an Î±-particle is affected by the nucleus of an atom. 
The repository includes the source code, word document of the paper and a PDF format version of the paper. This paper was written as an entry to the Computational Physics Prize of Eton College in 2022. 
The project received a overall of 2nd runner up ('Highly Commendable'), and it was the winner of the non-specialist class (Y11 and below).
